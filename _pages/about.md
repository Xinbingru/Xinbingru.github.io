<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I was born in Shanxi Province, China in December, 2000. From 2018 to 2022, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Sichuan University. In 2022, I will continue to study for a master's degree in engineering in the School of Chemical Engineering of Sichuan University, dedicated to the research of process systems engineering, and I am expected to graduate in 2025.

My research interest includes machine learning and deep learning for chemical engineering materials and processes. At present, I have published four SCI papers, of which one is the first author, one is the co-first author, one is the second author and one is the other author. This is my <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H7oehLIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>google scholar<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>

**Bingru Xin**, Minggao Feng, Min Cheng, et al. [Combining interpretable machine learning and molecular simulation to advance the discovery of COF-based membrane for acid gas separation [J]](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c00855), Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, 2024, Accept.

- In this paper, we propose a method combining interpretable machine learning and molecular simulation to discover the optimal acid gas separation membrane materials from more than 70,000 covalent organic frameworks(COFs)-based membranes. Based on GCMC and MD simulation to calculate gas permeability data, an automated machine learning model is constructed by extracting 20 feature descriptors. Chemical insights of membrane separation were obtained based on the characteristic contribution of SHAP analysis.

- This paper presents a classification based convolutional neural network fault diagnosis method for chemical processes. The model architecture is divided into classification layer and diagnosis layer, and the fault set is divided into different types to the corresponding subnet layer, and the fault diagnosis model is developed for each subnetwork. The model can adapt to various fault types of chemical processes and has high diagnostic accuracy.

Qingbo Xu‚Ä†, **Bingru Xin‚Ä† (Co-first)**, Jing Wei, et al. [Troger's base polymeric membranes for CO<sub>2</sub> separation: a review [J]](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3TA03017B), Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 2023, 11, 15600-15634.
- This paper reviews and introduces gas separation membranes based on  Troger's base(TB) polymers for CO<sub>2</sub> separation. TB polymer is a polymer material connected by rigid V-shaped bridging bicyclic groups, which can enhance the rigidity of the polymer and prevent chain stacking. This paper focuses on the application of pure TB polymer membrane, functional TB polymer membrane, TB polymer-based mixed matrix membrane (MMM) and high temperature modified carbon molecular sieve(CMS)/thermal rearrangement(TR) membrane in the field of CO<sub>2</sub> separation. In addition, the future possible applications and improvement methods of TB polymer membranes are also proposed, further emphasizing the importance of data-driven for membrane separation.
