# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me

Welcome! I am now a master student in the School of Chemical Engineering of Sichuan University. My current work focuses on the material intersection of machine learning and molecular simulation. I am interested in the prediction and discovery of properties of porous materials (MOF/COF/PNN) and polymer materials through a combination of machine learning (deep learning), molecular simulation, and materials informatics.

From 2018 to 2022, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree from School of Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University (ÂõõÂ∑ùÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÂåñÂ≠¶Â∑•Á®ãÂ≠¶Èô¢). In 2022, I embarked on my journey towards a master's degree in the School of Chemical Engineering of Sichuan University, dedicated to the research of Process Systems Engineering (PSE). I anticipate completing my studies and earning my master's degree in 2025.

In 2024, I joined Dow Chemical<img src='./images/Dow.png' style='width: 4em;'> as part of the "Advanced Digital Intern for Science and Engineering" program (one of 14 in Asia Pacific). I will use computer vision technology to detect anomalies in photovoltaic panel luminescence.

My research interest includes machine learning and deep learning for chemical engineering materials and processes. At present, I have published four SCI papers, of which one is the first author, one is the co-first author, one is the second author and one is the other author. This is my <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H7oehLIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>google scholar<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>.

**Especially! I am looking for a possible PhD opportunity (25fall).** If you are looking for the right candidate or for any kind of academic exchange and collaboration, please do not hesitate to email me: [xinbingru@gmail.com](mailto:xinbingru@gmail.com).

- In this paper, we propose a method combining interpretable machine learning and molecular simulation to discover the optimal acid gas separation membrane materials from more than 70,000 covalent organic frameworks(COFs)-based membranes. Based on GCMC and MD simulation to calculate gas permeability data, an automated machine learning model is constructed by extracting 20 feature descriptors. Chemical insights of membrane separation were obtained based on the characteristic contribution of SHAP analysis.

- This paper presents a classification based convolutional neural network fault diagnosis method for chemical processes. The model architecture is divided into classification layer and diagnosis layer, and the fault set is divided into different types to the corresponding subnet layer, and the fault diagnosis model is developed for each subnetwork. The model can adapt to various fault types of chemical processes and has high diagnostic accuracy.

- This paper reviews and introduces gas separation membranes based on  Troger's base(TB) polymers for CO<sub>2</sub> separation. TB polymer is a polymer material connected by rigid V-shaped bridging bicyclic groups, which can enhance the rigidity of the polymer and prevent chain stacking. This paper focuses on the application of pure TB polymer membrane, functional TB polymer membrane, TB polymer-based mixed matrix membrane (MMM) and high temperature modified carbon molecular sieve(CMS)/thermal rearrangement(TR) membrane in the field of CO<sub>2</sub> separation. In addition, the future possible applications and improvement methods of TB polymer membranes are also proposed, further emphasizing the importance of data-driven for membrane separation.
